                <h3 class="text-cyan">1. Support For HP 8.0 Has Ended</h3>
                <p>You will not find PHP <=Version 8.0 in the latest Laravel 10. For Laravel 10, the latest requirement is PHP 8.1. PHP 8.0 is no longer supported in Laravel 10, so upgrading to PHP 8.1 or 8.2 is required, even though updating your Laravel applications to the most recent version of Laravel as soon as it is released is not necessary. Nevertheless, extensive testing is still recommended, particularly for projects involving paid clients or employees. Additionally, Predis v1 support has ended, as has PHP 8.0 support, and you must upgrade to Predis v2.</p>

                <h3 class="text-cyan">2. Artisan (Installation Of Laravel 10)</h3>
                <p>Artisan, an integrated tool provided by Laravel, can complete most of the repetitive and time-consuming programming tasks that PHP developers typically avoid. The artisans can likewise be used to create the database’s structure, a skeleton code, and their migration to make the database system relatively easy to use. It can also directly generate MVC files from the command line to manage those assets and their configurations. Developers can use artisan to create their commands as well.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">3. Default Invokable Validation Rules</h3>
                <p>When developing a new Invokable management in Laravel 9, the –invokable flag had to be added after the artisan command. However, in Laravel 10, you can easily create a new Invokable rule by running the following command: Additionally, the boilerplate code is simple to understand, making it less stern for programmers to develop their own individualized validation rules.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">4. Skeleton Code For An Application With Type Declarations</h3>
                <p>In the past, DocBlocks were used in Laravel’s skeleton code to clearly explain a particular code’s function and the responses or parameters it returns. However, all user codes within the framework will now include type-hints and return types, thanks to the most recent Type Declarations.Method Arguments, Return Types, removing unnecessary annotations whenever possible, excluding the Types property, and giving users access to closure arguments are some of the other features. The core framework’s backward compatibility is unaffected by these enhancements, which add additional benefits.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">5. Exhibited the Laravel Pennant</h3>
                <p>The Laravel Pennat is a lightweight and easy-to-use feature flag package that makes it simple to add new features to your application. It sustains trunk-based development techniques, has an interface design for A/B testing, and more. Using feature flags, you can turn on or off a feature at runtime without changing the code.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">6. MVC Architecture Support</h3>
                <p>Using an MVC design pattern, you can use Laravel to separate the business logic and presentation layers. Laravel’s MVC design includes several built-in features that improve the application’s scalability, performance, and security.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">7. dispatchNow() Removed</h3>
                <p>The “dispatchNow()” method was deprecated in Laravel 9 and has since been replaced with “dispatchSync()” in Laravel 10. Because it is a fundamental change, you must return it to your current projects. However, the solution is straightforward.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h3 class="text-cyan">8. Libraries OO</h3>
                <p>Laravel provides developers with a plethora of features thanks to the assistance of object-oriented libraries. These are only available in Laravel and not in any other PHP framework. Hashing, password resets, encryption, and the capability to confirm existing users are just a few of the cutting-edge features in this library that come pre-installed.</p>
